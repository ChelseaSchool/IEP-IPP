/* Notes
 * 1. not the same style as most of the code by the dev
 * 2. some security measures in place (checking the filename for slashes and backslashes
 * 3. Purpose: It looks like this displays a generated PDF? Yes, it looks like it's supposed to be a tmp file with a limited lifespan. (does not stay on server)
 * 4. Special handling again for IE
 * 5. errors don't seem to go to log
 * 6. Array $http_get_vars (all caps) should be checked into
